			<p>State parks and beaches attract tourists from around the world, adding $108 billion alone in 2015 to Florida's economy.
			Many wildlife areas in Florida are home to sepcies that cannot be found elsewhere in the world, like the Florida Jay Scrub, which can be found only in the Everglades.
			Rising sea levels and deforestation pushes these species out of their natural homes, forcing them to live in areas where they may not be able to survive.
			Wildlife areas in Florida are not only home to a vast variety of animal species, but they are key to helping Floridians live. A majority of the state rests
			atop a natural aquifer, and when sea levels rise or dangerous chemicals from fracking spills into the aquifer, Floridians suffer.</p>

			<h1>climate change? but it's cold outside!</h1>
			<p>Between $15 and $23 billion of existing property in Florida will likely be underwater by 2050.
			Three-fourths of Florida's 20 million residents live in coastal communities. Why aren't we more concerned about sea level rise that is brought upon by climate change?
			University of Miami researchers have found that the average rate of sea level rise over the last decade increased from 3mm per year in 206, to 9mm per year after 2006.
			That may seem like a small number, but in Miami you can already see the impact. During normal high tides, the water level rises high enough that it floods storm drains and flows into the streets,
			leaving the local government no choice but to pour millions into raising roadways and installing pumps to force the water out. This water also gets into the aquifer, causing increased
			salinity of freshwater sources. Rising sea levels affecting wildlife across the state as well, forcing animals out of their natural habitats to higher or more nothern grounds, leading to population
			decrease. </p>

			<p>While many local governments have banned fracking, the state has yet to move on a ban.
	 Fracking is when chemicals and water are injected into the ground to dissolve oil filled rock.
	 Many of the chemicals used are hazardous, and if consumed, can cause a miriad of health issues
	 like cancer. During the process of fracking, these dangerous chemicals are directly injected into
	 the ground, and since Florida has such a shallow aquifer, can leak into the aquifer and affect drinking water sources.
	 The contamination of the water can also lead to health problems in wildlife, ut the biggest threat fracking poses to wildlife is
	 habitat destruction.</p>
